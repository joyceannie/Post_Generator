"Being underestimated is a silent advantage. 
 
A secret ingredient to success. 
 
When you do something big and bold, skeptics will always come knocking at your door. 
 
Your doubters will be excited to prove just how 'right' they are. 
 
But being overlooked and underestimated can be a big advantage. 
 
When people expect very little of you, you get this awesome space where you are free to innovate and make unexpected moves that catch the market off guard. 
 
You can move forward in stealth, under a veil of modest expectations. 
 
Let the doubters doubt, while you move silently ahead. 
 
Because every challenge you overcome on this path helps prove you were right all along. 
 
And, trust me, you are. 
 
Good luck this week."
