"Your startup needs a brand strategy.

If you want to generate revenue quickly, that is.

Here's why 👇🏼

A brand strategy provides clarity around:

- who you should target
- how to communicate with them
- why they should buy from you
- where to engage with them
- the journey they go through to buy
- what experience will turn them into raving fans
- how to generate word of mouth
- how you should focus your marketing
- what type of content you should create
- how to price your services
- how to shorten your sales cycle
- the look and feel of everything you put out
- the type of people to hire

In other words, everything you need to grow a business.

A brand strategy is that guiding light, North Star, or driving force.

Something every business should have.

Especially startups.

Unless you like making foolish mistakes that cost big.

To each their own, I guess.
