"Start with a strategy.

Or you'll be a slave to the ever-changing algorithm.

Most hashtag#LinkedIn advice out there are algorithm hacks.

- selfies
- engagement
- hook templates
- 'authentic' sob stories
- personalized connection requests

‚òùüèº Those are all about gaming the algorithm.

Now, there's nothing wrong with optimizing content for the algorithm.

It literally is how your content is distributed on the platform.

But a strange thing happens when you're focused on more likes.

Your content (and brand) starts to suffer.

You start to play to every algorithm hack that exists.

And trust me, I've seen this every year on LinkedIn.

- 2019 = engagement group (pods)
- 2020 = 'I hired a homeless person as my CEO' stories
- 2021 = polls
- 2022 = selfies
- 2023 = 'authentic' sob stories

Great content sacrificed on the altar of the algorithm.

You know what prevents that from happening?

A strategy.

I never jumped on any of those algorithm hacks.

Even though every influencer, personal brander, and LinkedIn guru pushed them as the ONLY way to grow on the platform.

And a crazy thing happened.

I kept landing clients with my content.

Because a strategy does that.

Provides you direction on what you SHOULD do.

To get the results YOU want.

Imagine that.
