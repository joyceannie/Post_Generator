"You should write online every single day. 
 
Here's what will happen: 
 
- Some people will love it. 
- Some people will hate it. 
- Many people will ignore it. 
 
It doesn't matter. 
 
Writing is a critical piece of personal growth. 
 
If you want to start writing, here are 3 things that have worked for me: 
 
1. Build something 
 
Anything. A website. A newsletter. An app. A course. An eBook. A marketplace. A car. 
 
Then, write about the ups and downs. 
 
Publish it. 
 
2. Journal for 15 minutes at the end of each day. 
 
What did you learn that day? Brain dump it. 
 
Cut out all the fluff. Make it easy to digest. 
 
Post it. 
 
3. Reframe interesting articles
 
Schedule time each week to review saved articles. 
 
Pull out the most interesting thing you read and write your perspective on it. 
 
Add your flair + send it. 
 
Or do none of these things and try something else, because what works for me may not work for you. 
 
But if you're trying, at least you're starting. 
 
Try today. 
 
It's a muscle you'll never regret building."
