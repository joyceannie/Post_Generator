"Here's my entire $4.8M business plan: 
 
(feel free to steal it) 
 
1. Write content that shines a light on a problem my customers face. 
 
2. Link to an article that walks through a basic solution to that problem. 
 
3. Inside of that article I position one of my products that will help them solve the problem completely on their own. 
 
4. Send them to a landing page that clearly explains who the product is for, what it will help them do, what's inside, and what other people (just like them) think of it. 
 
5. Deliver 100x the value of what they paid for it with both their money AND their time. 
 
6. Ask them to spread the word to other people who might have the same problem. 
 
That's basically it."
