"Had a call last week with a new solopreneur looking to scale to $100k. 
 
Here are the 5 pieces of advice I shared: 
 
1. Nail Your Unique Selling Proposition (USP): 
 
Start with the basics. Why should anyone choose your business over the countless others out there? 
 
Spend time nailing a USP that sets you apart but also resonates deeply with your perfect, ideal customer. Not everyone. 
 
2. Build Systems, Not Just Goals: 
 
A goal without a system is just a wish. 
 
Instead of just trying to hit six figures, create processes that will get you there. Marketing funnels, optimized content processes, and systems that help you retain customers. 
 
You can't control outcomes, but you can control the systems that influence those outcomes. 
 
3. Know Your Numbers: 
 
You'd be surprised at how many people overlook this. 
 
You need to know your numbers inside and out — not just revenue and profit, but also all of the metrics that tell you where your customers are coming from. 
 
If you don’t understand what’s working, how can you do more of it? 
 
4. Prioritize Customer Experience: 
 
Hitting revenue numbers isn't just about acquiring customers; it's also about keeping them and having them tell others. 
 
Be responsive, over-deliver, and always listen to customer feedback. The more you can make each customer feel valued, the more likely they are to return and refer others — creating a flywheel that helps you grow. 
 
5. Don't Neglect Personal Development: 
 
Last but not least, invest in yourself. You are the most valuable asset your business has. 
 
Take courses to improve your skills, find a mentor, and allocate time to care for your body and mind. As you grow, your business will too. 
 
If you don’t take care of yourself, your business will suffer. 
 
Scaling your business is extremely hard, but entirely achievable. 
 
Give some thought to these 5 pieces of advice and I guarantee you'll give yourself a better opportunity to win in the game of solopreneurship.
