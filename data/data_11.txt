"What does a brand strategy actually look like?

☝🏼 I get that question a lot.

Most people see the word 'brand' and immediately think:

- logo
- fonts
- colors
- design
- feelings

All aspects of a brand, for sure. 

But a brand strategy is far more than that.

Here's the bare minimum that you should have in a brand strategy 👇🏼

1. Ideal Customer Profile
Your brand is created for THEM, not you.

2. Competitive Research
What are the holes in the market?

3. Positioning/Differentiation
How will you show up and be different?

4. Messaging
How will you communicate that differentiation?

5. Touchpoints
How will you show that differentiation through marketing, sales, operations, product, and customer support?

6. Tactical Plan
What steps will you take to make all of that happen?

7. Strategy Statement
What's the overall strategy that will drive everything you do?

☝🏼 This is the bare minimum you should have in a brand strategy.

Because this will align your efforts.

And help you attract the RIGHT customers.

Now, you can expand that strategy to include:
- personality
- tone and voice
- brand/founder story
- benefits and guarantees
- logos, fonts, colors, patterns
- marketing and content strategy

But for most of you, that's overkill.

At least for now. 

Start with the essentials.

You'll gain far more clarity and direction for your business.

Which, in turn, means more...

MONEY.

If you're into that sort of thing, that is.

(some of you clearly aren't)
