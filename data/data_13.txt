"Right now is the greatest era of self-promotion in history. 
 
The attention economy. 
 
More eyeballs mean: 
 
- A better network 
- Better job opportunities 
- Better project opportunities 
- Better income opportunities 
 
Creating your own luck has never been easier. 
 
The upside is infinite while the downside is almost non-existent. 
 
So, don't be afraid to promote yourself. 
 
Be afraid of being unknown."
