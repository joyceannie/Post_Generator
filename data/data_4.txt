"Here are 12 powerful pieces of advice I'd give to aspiring internet entrepreneurs: 
 
1. There is a business idea in your practical work experience, but also in the things you are obsessed with. Lean in. 
 
2. Your unique value proposition is key to your success. Why should someone choose you over all of the people out there? 
 
3. Distribution is your best friend. If you can't share you message effectively, you're going to struggle. 
 
4. Create content you enjoy creating, not what you think is best. Like to write? Write. Like video? Record. Consistency is what matters, so you'd better like it. 
 
5. Create systems and frameworks for turning your ideas into creative pieces of content that people will enjoy. No systems? Gonna be tough. 
 
6. Build for the long-term. Rather than trying to generate a ton of revenue right from the start, think about under-promising, under-pricing, and over-delivering. That early trust will pay off in the long run. 
 
7. The more niche you are, the more you can sell products and services. The more broad you are, the more creative you'll have to get. 
 
8. You become really good when you understand who you're serving, what you're helping them do, and what outcome they can expect. This becomes your content language. 
 
9. You become great when you analyze everything you're doing, and form hypotheses about what's working and what isn't. 
 
10. You become excellent when you take action against those hypotheses until you solve the problems. 
 
11. Business is never done. You're either moving forward or getting worse. The default mode in entrepreneurship is reverse. 
 
12. Automation is the great differentiator. If your revenue can be generated by content and email sequences that work when you're sleeping, you'll be tough to beat."
