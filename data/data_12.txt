"Business ideas are a dime a dozen. 
 
99.9% of people have a million of them. 
 
But an idea is pretty meaningless if you don't bring it to life. 
 
If you're stuck, here's how to begin: 
 
1. Choose One Idea: 
 
Pick something you've considered building. It could be anything: 
 
- An eBook 
- A consultancy 
- A video course 
- A coaching business 
 
Anything. Just pick the one idea that most resonates with you. 
 
2. Do Some Quick Research: 
 
Go to a site like Answer Socrates and start plugging in keywords. 
 
What questions are people asking on Google? 
 
Use advanced LinkedIn and Twitter search to find people talking about the topic. What are they trying to figure out? 
 
This will give you a sense of what challenges people have. 
 
3. Create a Simple Plan: 
 
- What are the business goals? 
- What are the important milestones? 
- What are your critical daily actions? 
 
4. Start Small: 
 
Don't immediately start selling. Create some useful content that leads people on a journey. 
 
You move your customer through stages by answering these questions: 
 
- Problem unaware: Do I have a problem? 
- Problem aware: Is there a solution? 
- Solution aware: Do you have a solution? 
- Product aware: Why your solution? 
 
5. Evaluate & Adjust: Refine as you go. 
 
After 30 days, check to see what's working and what isn't working. 
 
Do 2x more of what is. 
Stop doing what isn't. 
 
Remember - building a business isn't about having endless ideas. 
 
It's about actioning your idea to make it grow."
